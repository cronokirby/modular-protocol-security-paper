\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we sought to develop a modular framework for analyzing
the security of protocols.
We did this by extending the standalone security
formalism of state-separable proofs \cite{AC:BDFKK18}.
The result is a framework for protocol security with similar
modular properties to those of state-separable proofs,
and with a strong connection with that formalism,
allowing for results in standalone security to be used
in showing the security of protocols.

While we believe our framework is already suitable
for proving the security of protocols, we expect
shortcomings to be discovered as the framework sees more use.
The novelty of the framework also provides a disadvantage
in that not many proofs have been written in it,
and many common UC idioms may not translate directly
either.
We hope that this disadvantage can diminish over time as more
more work is conducted using this or similar frameworks.
