\section{Differences with UC Security}

In this section, we outline a few differences between
the framework we've developed, and that of UC security
\cite{EPRINT:Canetti00}.
Despite these differences, we think that the frameworks
ultimately remain quite compatible, 
in that proofs in one framework should translate well
to proofs in the other.
This process is not, by any means, automatic,
as is the case for other variants of UC,
such as \cite{C:CanCohLin15}.
