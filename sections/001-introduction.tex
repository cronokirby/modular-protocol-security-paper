\section{Introduction}

Universally composable (UC) security \cite{EPRINT:Canetti00}
has seen widespread success since its introduction over
two decades ago,
becoming the dominant framework for analyzing the security of cryptographic
protocols.

This success is understandable, because the guarantees
the framework provides are very useful.
In essence, when a protocol is proved secure in the UC framework,
then arbitrary instances of that protocol can be used concurrently in the context
of a larger system, without modifying the behavior
of these protocols.
This allows the analysis of isolated components to be used
to guarantee the security of a system as a whole;
this modular analysis is essential to being able to scale
formal analysis to larger systems.

games are still used, hard to write

variants have been developed

nonetheless, still hard, also informal

in this work, we propose

\subsection{Our Framework}

More modular, formal, and simpler.

most similar to.

we also formalize state separable proofs while we're at it, why not.

\subsection{Overview}

as mentioned above, we need to first define packages,
systems, etc.
