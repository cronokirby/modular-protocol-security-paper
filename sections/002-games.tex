\section{State-Separable Proofs}

Our framework for describing protocols is based on 
\emph{state-separable proofs}
\cite{AC:BDFKK18}.
The security notions we develop for protocols ultimately
find meaning in analogous notions of security for \emph{packages},
the main object of study in state-seperable proofs.

This section is intended to be a suitable independent presentation
of this formalism.
In that spirit, we develop state-separable proofs ``from scratch''.
Our starting point is merely that of computable randomized functions.
This is in contrast to other protocol security frameworks like UC,
whose foundational starting point is usually the more concrete notion
of \emph{interactive turing machines}.

We also take the opportunity to solidify the formalism of state-separable
proofs, providing more complete definitions of various objects,
completing several proofs left as mere sketches in the original paper,
and proving a few additional properties we'll need later.
This makes this section of interest to readers who are already familiar
with state-separable proofs.
