    If you had a time machine, what cryptography would you be able to break?

    In this work, we investigate the notion of time travel, formally defining models for adversaries
    equipped with a time machine, and exploring the consequences
    for cryptography.
    We find that being able to rewind time breaks some
    cryptographic schemes, and being able to freely move both
    forwards and backwards in time breaks even more schemes.

    We look at the impacts of time travel on encryption and signatures in particular,
    finding that the $\text{IND-CCA}$ and $\text{EUF-CMA}$ security
    games are broken, while $\text{IND-CPA}$ and $\text{UUF-CMA}$
    remain secure.
