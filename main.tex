\begin{abstract}

Universally composable (UC) security \cite{EPRINT:Canetti00}
is the most widely used framework for analyzing the security of cryptographic
protocols.
Many variants and simplifications of the framework have been proposed and developed,
nonetheless, many practitioners find UC proofs to be both difficult
to construct and understand.
We remedy this situation by proposing a new framework for protocol security.
We believe that our framework provides proofs that are both
easier to write, but also more rigorous, and easier to understand.
Our framework is highly \emph{modular}, allowing the decomposition
of large proofs into a series of simpler proofs,
and also builds upon
the framework of state-separable proofs
\cite{AC:BDFKK18}, allowing for standalone security results
to be used to reason about the security of protocols.
